# Courteous

Alice gathered her team in the conference room for the weekly meeting. Today was special; she had an announcement to make.

"Hey team, I want to talk to you about something that's crucial for our success—our interaction with other departments and partners. We're going to be interfacing with Greg's team from Sales for a critical project, and let's say, he can be a bit...demanding."

There was a collective sigh; everyone had heard stories about Greg.

"But that shouldn't deter us from being courteous and respectful in all our interactions," Alice continued. "It doesn't matter how stressful or complicated things get. We should always be attentive to others' needs, communicate clearly, and maintain a professional demeanor. A good leader—and a good team—shows respect and consideration for others, regardless of their position or background."

Just then, there was a knock on the door, and Greg himself walked in, unannounced. He immediately started laying out his expectations for the upcoming project. His tone was not the friendliest, but Alice kept her composure.

"Thank you for outlining your needs, Greg," Alice replied. "My team and I are looking forward to working collaboratively with your department. Let's set up a time to dive deeper into the project specifics."

Greg paused, a bit disarmed by Alice's respectful and professional manner. "Alright, let's do that," he finally said.

As he left, Alice turned back to her team. "See, courtesy goes a long way. It helps build a culture of respect and cooperation. It even makes demanding people easier to work with. Plus, it's just the right thing to do."

The team nodded in agreement. Alice's principles were clear, and everyone felt motivated to uphold them.

## Benefits of Being Courteous

Being courteous in the workplace has far-reaching implications that extend beyond mere pleasantries. When you're a leader who consistently displays courteous behavior, you're laying the foundation for trust within your team. This trust, once established, sets the stage for open and effective communication, making it easier to address issues and share ideas. Courtesy from a leader also sets a standard for respect, encouraging team members to treat one another in the same manner. Over time, this cultivates a collaborative atmosphere where people are more willing to work together. Additionally, being consistently courteous enhances your reputation within the organization, sending a message that you're not just a leader but also a person of character.

Courtesy isn't just important for leaders; it's crucial for team members as well. When you're polite and considerate in your interactions, it opens the door for honest dialogue among colleagues. This open communication can strengthen the bonds between team members, making for a more cohesive unit. Courtesy also acts as a natural conflict reducer, helping to keep the team's morale high and creating a more pleasant working environment for everyone. On a personal level, courteous behavior makes you more approachable, which could lead to more opportunities for professional growth. Lastly, let's not overlook the simple fact that courteous environments generally make for more enjoyable workplaces, boosting job satisfaction for you and those around you.

So, it's worth taking a moment to self-reflect on how courtesy manifests in your daily work life. Consider times when stress may have caused you to be less than courteous and think about the ripple effects that may have had. Ask yourself how you can weave courteous actions more deeply into your leadership or teamwork style. Think about strategies to encourage politeness and respectful behavior throughout your team or organization. Finally, observe if there's a noticeable link between courteous behavior and other positive outcomes in your workplace. These reflections can serve as a roadmap to creating a culture where courtesy is a cornerstone.
