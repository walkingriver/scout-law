# Reverent

As the clock struck midnight, Alice sat alone in her office, staring at the final line of the build system's log that marked the completion of their long, arduous project. The room was filled with the soft hum of computers and the ambient light from multiple monitors. She didn't need to be here this late, but wanted to wait until the last deploy succeeded and the system was officially live in production.

She reflected on all they'd been through, and now that the project was done, everything rested in the hands of their customers. It felt like the end of an era, and as she closed her laptop, a wave of emotions washed over her.

She got up from her desk, let out a long sigh, and walked to her car.

The next morning, she called for a team meeting. The atmosphere was palpable; the collective sense of relief, tinged with the exhaustion of the previous months, was in the air.

"Congratulations, we did it," Alice began, her voice tinged with a reverence that immediately commanded everyone's attention. "But before we move on to the next challenge or dive into post-mortems, I want us to take a moment to reflect on this journey. Not just on what we've achieved but also on the people who helped us get here."

Alice displayed a presentation with the faces of everyone on the team and key contributors from other departments who had chipped in during crunch times.

"I want us to take a moment of silence to honor every person who made this possible. From Mark, who came in as an intern and contributed game-changing ideas, to Daniel in HR who made sure we had the resources we needed. They've all been part of this epic journey. I even want to call out Greg," to which there were a few polite chuckles and one soft groan.

The room went silent. It was a moment to honor not just the skill and labor that had gone into the project, but also the diversity of thought, the disagreements turned constructive, and the unquantifiable spirit that had fueled their late nights and early mornings.

Breaking the silence, Alice continued, "Reverence is often thought of in a religious or spiritual context, but here, in this setting, it takes on a new meaning. It's respect for each other's talents, acknowledgment of each other's sacrifices, and most importantly, a deep-seated appreciation for the humanity that drives us to be better, to do better."

She paused to make eye contact with each person in the room. "In the days ahead, as we move on to new projects and challenges, let's carry this reverence with us. Let's respect the unique beliefs, cultures, and opinions that each one brings to the table. Let's maintain this atmosphere where every voice is heard, every effort appreciated, and every individual respected. Because that, my friends, is the essence of a truly great team."

The room broke into soft applause, some wiping away tears. As they filed out of the meeting room, each team member felt a renewed sense of purpose, inspired not just by the success of their project, but by the culture of reverence that Alice had instilled in themâ€”a culture they knew would be the bedrock of future successes.

The experience with Alice and her team holds a mirror to what workplaces could look like when reverence is an active part of the culture. It's not just about completing projects or meeting deadlines; it's about recognizing the human element in every endeavor. Reverence, in a professional context, is the humble recognition that we are a collective, knit together by mutual respect and common goals. It places value on the intellectual contributions as much as it appreciates the emotional labor that often goes unseen.

When Alice chose to honor every team member and external contributor, she did more than just pay lip service to an ideal; she fostered a sense of belonging. This sense of inclusion, born out of reverence for each individual's unique contributions, encourages team members to invest not just their time and skills, but their hearts into their projects. It builds loyalty, not just to the company, but to the ideals that the company represents.

Reverence extends to how we interact with colleagues, but it also informs the respect we must afford to ourselves. It manifests as a form of self-respect that encourages continuous learning and growth, not for the accolades, but for the intrinsic joy of becoming better at one's craft. It's also about respecting the work-life boundaries that keep us human, reminding us that work is a part of life, not the other way around.

Moreover, it goes beyond the confines of the office. It considers the impact of our actions on the world and urges us to be good stewards of the resources we consume. It's a culture that reveres not just success, but the ethical means by which that success is achieved.

In embracing these aspects of reverence, we open the door to a more compassionate, understanding, and ultimately more productive work environment. It may seem like a soft approach in a world that often prioritizes the bottom line, but as Alice and her team demonstrated, it's a paradigm that can yield both emotional and financial dividends.

## Self Reflection

1. How do I currently show respect and appreciation to my team members, and how could I improve?
2. How often do I acknowledge and celebrate the unseen emotional labor that goes into teamwork?
3. Do I take the time to reflect on the ethical implications of my decisions at work?
4. How do I maintain a sense of reverence or respect for myself, particularly during stressful projects?
5. What steps can I take to instill a sense of purpose and meaning within my team, beyond just completing tasks or projects?
