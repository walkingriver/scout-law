# Courteous

A few days later, Alice gathered her team in the conference room for their usual bi-weekly planning meeting. However, today held an air of anticipation and unease as Alice had an important matter to discuss.

"Hey team, I want to talk to you about something that's crucial for our collaboration," Alice began, her tone measured. "We've recently faced a situation that requires our collective attention. Greg, from Sales, has learned that a key feature he had been expecting has been cut, and he's furious about it."

Someone, Alice didn't catch who, muttered, "Oh no, not Greg!"

Immediately, Mark couldn't help but voice his curiosity, "What's up with Greg?"

Roger, known for his characteristic cynicism, seized the opportunity to share a more detailed perspective, "Well, Mark, get ready to meet Greg â€“ the kind of person who can erupt like a volcano when things don't go his way. When he's angry, he doesn't discriminate; he'll lash out in anger at the nearest person he thinks might be responsible."

Mark looked over at Roger and asked, "I take it you have been the target of this volcano?"

Roger barked out a laugh and replied, "Oh yeah! During my first year working here, I was tasked with handling some data that didn't align with what Greg needed for a presentation. He stormed into my office like a hurricane, blaming me for the 'data disaster.' I learned quickly to keep my cool and defuse the situation because, with Greg, it's either that or risk getting burned."

Alice decided to cut off the conversation before things got out of hand.

She reminded everyone about the twelve attributes she'd written on the whiteboard on their first day together, and reminded the team to remain cheerful, no matter what.

"Remember," she quoted one of her favorite authors, Elizabeth Kenny, "'He who angers you conquers you.' Don't let him get to you. If Greg raises his voice, lower yours. The more he frowns, the more we'll smile. If you prepare ahead of time, you may even find it's a fun game. I know I do."

With Alice's warning fresh in their minds, the team braced themselves for what was to come. It didn't take long. The door swung open abruptly, and Greg stormed in, his face already etched with irritation.

"Good morning, Alice," Greg greeted with a tone that hinted at his impatience. Mark could see immediately why he his outbursts were legendary throughout the company.

"I need to know what happened to the feature I promised my customers," Greg demanded, his voice rising with each word. "They were expecting it in the upcoming release, and now they're furious!"

Alice, as she'd reminded her team, kept her composure and replied calmly and courteously, "Good morning, Greg. I understand your concern. Due to some budget cuts, we had to reprioritize certain features. Your feature is still a top priority, and it will be included in the next release, later this year."

Greg wouldn't let it go, however. It didn't matter what other priorities the project had. His feature was the most important and should be included in the first release.

Alice, however, lowered her voice even more, and gently reminded Greg that feature priorities weren't his to make. That authority rested with the business team and the product owner, who had made their decisions. His feature would be prioritized in the next release.

Greg's face turned even redder as he continued to express his frustration, his voice growing louder with each passing moment. He leaned forward, emphasizing his points with sweeping gestures. His demands were becoming more unreasonable, and it was clear that he was not going to let the matter drop easily.

Alice maintained her courteous and composed demeanor, her voice unwavering as she addressed Greg's concerns. She patiently reiterated the situation and the steps they were taking to meet customer expectations while acknowledging his frustrations. Despite the escalating tension, she kept her focus on finding a constructive resolution to the issue.

The rest of the team watched the exchange in awe of Alice's ability to remain calm in the face of Greg's outburst. Yes, they had heard stories about his temper, but witnessing it firsthand was a whole different experience. Sarah, in particular, was impressed by Alice's composure.

As the meeting progressed, Greg's anger gradually began to subside, replaced by a begrudging acceptance of the situation. He finally accepted that Alice and her team were doing their best and would get to his feature as soon as they could.

He grudgingly thanked them for their time and left. After he left the room, Alice turned to her team and reaffirmed the importance of courtesy in such challenging situations. The team nodded in agreement, inspired by Alice's ability to maintain professionalism, even in the face of a demanding and difficult counterpart like Greg.

Being courteous in the workplace has far-reaching implications that extend beyond mere pleasantries. When you're a leader who consistently displays courteous behavior, you're laying the foundation for trust within your team. This trust, once established, sets the stage for open and effective communication, making it easier to address issues and share ideas. Courtesy from a leader also sets a standard for respect, encouraging team members to treat one another in the same manner. Over time, this cultivates a collaborative atmosphere where people are more willing to work together. Additionally, being consistently courteous enhances your reputation within the organization, sending a message that you're not just a leader but also a person of character.

Courtesy isn't just important for leaders; it's crucial for team members as well. When you're polite and considerate in your interactions, it opens the door for honest dialogue among colleagues. This open communication can strengthen the bonds between team members, making for a more cohesive unit. Courtesy also acts as a natural conflict reducer, helping to keep the team's morale high and creating a more pleasant working environment for everyone. On a personal level, courteous behavior makes you more approachable, which could lead to more opportunities for professional growth. Lastly, let's not overlook the simple fact that courteous environments generally make for more enjoyable workplaces, boosting job satisfaction for you and those around you.

So, it's worth taking a moment to self-reflect on how courtesy manifests in your daily work life. Consider times when stress may have caused you to be less than courteous and think about the ripple effects that may have had. Ask yourself how you can weave courteous actions more deeply into your leadership or teamwork style. Think about strategies to encourage politeness and respectful behavior throughout your team or organization. Finally, observe if there's a noticeable link between courteous behavior and other positive outcomes in your workplace. These reflections can serve as a roadmap to creating a culture where courtesy is a cornerstone.
