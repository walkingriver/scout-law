# Obedience

A week had passed since the intense meeting with Greg, and Alice's team had weathered the storm with grace and professionalism. As they settled back into their daily routines, the memory of their leader's poise in the face of adversity continued to inspire them. They were about to face a new challenge.

Alice scrutinized the email from upper management once more, ensuring she'd read it correctly. The directive was unmistakable: all teams were to transition to a new project management software by the week's end, with no exceptions. She sighed, acutely aware of the unfortunate timing. Her team had finally grown comfortable with their existing system, and this abrupt shift would undeniably disrupt their workflow and dampen their spirits.

Summoning a measured breath, she called for an impromptu team meeting. As the team gathered around, Alice sensed the palpable tension in the room. News of the software switch had already spread like wildfire.

"Look, I understand that the timing for this new software transition is far from ideal," she began, her tone empathetic. "But we've been handed a mandate, and our responsibility is to adhere to it."

A collective murmur of discontent rippled through the team.

Alice realized the importance of conveying the team's concerns to the higher-ups. She was aware of the potential challenges the sudden shift in software could pose, and she wanted to ensure the team's voice was heard.

She continued, her voice steady, "How about this? Tell me everything you love about this software and let's come up with an alternate proposal. I'll take it to Dave and see what I can do."

They spent the rest of the meeting brainstorming and coming up with a plan that Alice could present.

The next day, she scheduled a meeting with her manager Dave and other relevant decision-makers. She presented the team's concerns, highlighting their deep familiarity with the existing software and the potential disruption the transition might cause. She emphasized the value of the team's expertise and the potential loss of productivity during the adjustment period.

However, the decision had already been made at a higher level, driven by financial considerations to consolidate the company onto a single platform. Despite Alice's advocacy and the team's concerns, the transition was set in motion.

As a last-ditch effort, Alice requested the transition be postponed until version 1 of their project had been deployed to production. Unfortunately, as she learned, doing so would incur huge licensing costs to the company. They were unwilling to budge.

Alice returned to the team with the outcome of her meeting. "I appreciate your patience and your trust in me to represent your concerns," she began. "I took our case to the leadership team, and they've made it clear that this transition is non-negotiable. It's a financial decision aimed at streamlining our operations. We'll have to adapt as best as we can."

The news was met with a mixture of disappointment and resignation. The team knew they faced a challenging period ahead as they navigated the unfamiliar terrain of the new software system. Yet, in that moment, they also understood that Alice had done her utmost to advocate on their behalf, reinforcing their trust in her leadership.

Mark, taking a cue from Roger, piped up, "What if we just drag our feet and pretend to go along with it? Maybe they'll change their minds if we make it difficult enough."

Alice appreciated Mark's candor but knew that this approach wouldn't align with her principles. "I appreciate your honesty, Mark," she responded, "but that's not the way we should handle this situation. We can find a way to make this work without resorting to resistance."

As the team brainstormed ideas, Sarah, usually reserved but keenly observant, remembered the principles Alice had introduced them to on their very first day together. She spoke up, "What if we find a way to be obedient to the mandate while also optimizing our workflow? We could identify key features and customizations that would make the new software more efficient for our specific needs."

Alice's face lit up with approval. "That's an excellent suggestion, Sarah. It aligns with our principles of obedience and adds in a little ingenuity. Let's build on this. If we approach this transition with creativity and a willingness to adapt, we can not only fulfill the mandate but also enhance our processes."

Over the next couple of days, the team worked diligently to explore customizations and configurations that would align the new software with their established workflow.

Alice arranged for a product specialist from the vendor to provide them with a personalized walkthrough, helping them uncover ways to customize the software's configuration. They sought to emulate the workflow they'd grown accustomed to in the old system.

With the vendor's assistance, they created custom templates, set up efficient shortcuts, and fine-tuned project management settings to replicate the efficiency they had enjoyed with their previous system. Sarah's idea had provided the framework for their approach, allowing them to maintain a sense of ownership over their processes and ensuring their work remained efficient even in the face of unexpected challenges. This collaborative effort showcased their ability to be both obedient to the mandate and innovative in optimizing their workflow, embodying the principles Alice had introduced on their very first day together.

Obedience in a workplace setting isn't just a matter of doing what you're told; it's a complex interplay of loyalty, understanding, and adaptation. Alice showed that while the directive from upper management was non-negotiable, the way it was implemented within her team could still be influenced. Obedience, then, isn't a synonym for submission but rather an exercise in creative problem-solving within the boundaries set by the organization.

## Keeping the Bigger Picture in Mind

In situations where it might be easier to cut corners or ignore mandates, the key to maintaining obedience is remembering the larger context. Every directive is a piece of a bigger puzzle that aims to meet the overarching goals of the company. While it might be tempting to continue using old methods or disregard new protocols, doing so can lead to inconsistencies that affect not just your team but also others who are working under the same mandates.

## Fostering Innovation Through Obedience

Additionally, embracing obedience as an opportunity rather than a constraint can lead to surprising innovations. When we are pushed out of our comfort zones, it often forces us to reevaluate and potentially improve existing workflows and processes. It can even serve as a team-building exercise, as team members come together to navigate the challenges posed by the new directives.

## The Leader's Role

The attitude of the leader is crucial here. As a leader, taking a proactive approach to obedience—identifying potential problems, opening lines of communication, and offering constructive solutions—can drastically affect how the rest of the team views the situation. If the leader is visibly committed to making the best out of the directive, it becomes easier for the team to adopt the same attitude.

## Balancing Obedience and Creativity

Remember, obedience doesn't mean sacrificing the team's needs or giving up on innovation. Rather, it's a quality that can coexist with creativity, flexibility, and a concern for the team's well-being. It's about finding the most effective way to align the team's practices with the broader objectives of the organization, even when it's challenging to do so.

## Self Reflection

1. **How do I react when given a directive from higher-ups that I don't agree with?**

   - Am I open to understanding the reasoning behind the directive, even if I initially disagree?

2. **What steps can I take to ensure that following a mandate doesn't erode my team's morale?**
   - Do I actively involve my team in discussions about the directive and its implications?
3. **Have I considered how obeying a directive can be an opportunity for growth, both personally and as a team?**

   - Am I willing to explore innovative approaches or adapt existing processes when obeying a directive, even if it's challenging?

4. **Do I communicate clearly with my team when new directives come in, and do I involve them in the process of adaptation?**

   - Have I created an environment where my team feels comfortable sharing their concerns and suggestions regarding the directive?

5. **How can I balance the act of obedience with the need for team autonomy and happiness?**
   - Do I actively seek ways to align the directive's implementation with my team's values and well-being?
