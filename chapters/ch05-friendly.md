# Friendly

Alice looked at her watch and sighed. The company’s annual gala was about to start, and the cavernous ballroom was a whirlpool of tuxedos, ball gowns, and cocktail dresses. With hors d'oeuvres circulating and jazz music filling the air, it felt like a scene from a movie. A setting where networking was king and alliances were forged or broken over champagne toasts.

As she adjusted the delicate fabric of her dress, Alice saw her team walk in. Some looked uncomfortable in their formal attire; others seemed excited for a night away from workstations and status boards. Regardless, she knew this was an opportunity to forge stronger bonds, not just among the team members, but with others in the organization.

Walking up to Marisa, who looked equally elegant and out-of-place, Alice grinned. "You clean up well!"

Marisa chuckled, visibly relaxing. "So do you! I almost didn't recognize you without a whiteboard marker in hand."

Alice laughed and made her way to the rest of the team. As they greeted each other, she saw how the spirit of friendliness was more than just good manners. It was about building connections that could make work smoother, more collaborative, and, well, friendlier.

Seeing a few new faces from another department standing awkwardly at the edge of the room, Alice seized the opportunity. "Hey everyone, let's meet some new people!" she said, guiding her team towards them.

Soon, Alice was leading a merged group of old and new colleagues in an ice-breaking game she'd learned during her scouting days. It was simple, really—a few questions designed to make people share a little about themselves. Before long, the room was abuzz with conversations that ranged from weekend plans to why polar bears are left-handed.

As the night drew to a close, Alice felt proud of her team. She had noticed Roger, usually so reserved, animatedly discussing photography with someone from marketing. Marisa was now deeply engrossed in a conversation about sustainable design. New connections were made, and existing ones were strengthened.

Alice had successfully infused a spirit of friendliness into what could have been a stiff, transactional event. She knew that these social ties would spill over into work, making collaboration easier and problems simpler to solve. And it all stemmed from being friendly—approachable, warm, and empathetic to everyone, regardless of their role or background.

In that moment, she remembered the fourth point she had written on the whiteboard that day during the team's first meeting: "Friendliness." Yes, it might be an old scout's guideline, but it felt as relevant as ever.

Friendly leaders build strong relationships with their team members, customers, and stakeholders. By demonstrating warmth, empathy, and approachability, leaders can create a positive and productive work environment that fosters trust and cooperation.

## The Power of Friendliness

Friendliness is often undervalued in the professional realm, perceived as a 'soft skill' that takes a backseat to technical prowess or business acumen. However, leaders like Alice demonstrate that friendliness is indeed a powerful leadership quality that can drive both individual and collective success.

## Core Component of Effective Leadership

Friendliness is not just an add-on; it's a core component of effective leadership. By showing warmth and approachability, leaders like Alice create an environment where collaboration and trust thrive. These strong relationships can make the difference between a team that merely works together and one that excels.

## Fostering Genuine Connections

The real strength of friendliness lies in its ability to foster genuine connections. These connections serve as the foundation for trust, which is critical when you're navigating the complexities of teamwork and collaboration. Trusting relationships make it easier to address problems openly, pivot when necessary, and rally the team towards common goals.

## Encouraging Inclusivity and Diversity

Furthermore, a friendly disposition encourages inclusivity and diversity, which are cornerstones of innovation. When team members feel welcomed and valued, they're more likely to share their perspectives, contributing to richer discussions and better problem-solving.

## Shaping External Interactions

Finally, friendliness impacts not just internal team dynamics but also external interactions with clients, stakeholders, and other departments. A leader who exudes friendliness sets the tone for their team, influencing how they engage with the broader organization and its goals. So, in the bigger picture, friendliness is not just a team-building tool but a strategy for organizational success.

## Self Reflection

**1. How approachable do you consider yourself to be?**

- Consider how you interact with team members, especially those who may be more introverted or less familiar with you.

**2. When was the last time you actively facilitated team interactions?**

- Think about moments where you've gone out of your way to make team members feel included or bridge gaps between different departments.

**3. Do you engage with team members beyond work-related topics?**

- Assess how often you inquire about their well-being, interests, or challenges outside of the workplace, and consider how this contributes to building genuine relationships.

**4. How do you handle differences within the team?**

- Reflect on whether you're welcoming to all team members, regardless of their background, skills, or viewpoints.

**5. Are your networking efforts solely transactional or aimed at building meaningful relationships?**

- Evaluate your motives in networking settings. Are you looking to just get something in return, or do you genuinely want to know and help the other person?
