# Thrifty

As with most companies, the one thing you can always count on is to be faced with unexpected challenges. Budget cuts seem to be inevitable, particularly when the economy takes a downturn. While the team had admirably maintained their cheerfulness in the face of recent setbacks, the ripple effect of losing a key customer, along with the impending revenue reduction it entailed, could be felt throughout the entire company.

The atmosphere in the office was palpable, the weight of expected budget cuts casting a shadow over the team. Rumors swirled through the corridors like leaves in the wind, everyone whispering about potential layoffs. Alice felt it, too, but as the leader, she couldn't afford to join the murmur of worry that filled the room. She had just reminded them (and herself) how important it was to remain cheerful. Her team looked to her for guidance, and right now, she had to think of a way to be resourceful without sacrificing quality.

"Okay, team, we've all heard about the budget cuts," Alice said, addressing the room. "The situation is far from ideal, but we've been through tough times before. This is just another problem to solve. The project is still vital, and we need to figure out a way to make it happen."

Jordan, seldom one to keep his thoughts to himself, broke the silence. "Alice, we're already running lean. I don't know how we can cut any more without affecting the project's integrity."

Alice nodded, acknowledging the concern. "I hear you, Jordan. But if we don't find a way to adjust, the company might make that decision for us. I'd rather be proactive and come up with a solution that allows us to stay intact as a team."

Alice spent the evening pouring over budgets, project timelines, and resource allocations. Then it hit her. What if they could repurpose some of the existing code libraries and UI components they'd developed over the years? Instead of building everything from scratch, they could be thriftier by reusing and adapting what they already had.

The next morning, Alice gathered her team. "I have an idea. We've got a wealth of resources in our previous projects. We're going to do some tech scavenging. We'll identify reusable elements from our old projects and adapt them for the current one."

Sarah looked puzzled. "Wouldn't that compromise the quality? Some of those projects are pretty old, and our practices have improved since then."

Alice shook her head. "Not if we do it right. It's like recycling. You don't throw away a glass bottle; you clean it, melt it down, and make something new. The glass doesn't lose its quality; it just transforms."

The team spent the next week identifying reusable code and components. They found that nearly 30% of what they needed could be adapted from previous projects. Alice coordinated with other departments to temporarily borrow a couple of team members who had worked on those older projects. This helped them adapt the code more efficiently, and their unique skills became an asset to the team, adding a renewed sense of enthusiasm to the project.

A month later, the higher-ups noticed not only that Alice's team was on schedule but had also come in under the revised budget. Rather than layoffs, the department found itself in a surprising position: they were praised for their ingenuity and resourcefulness, a bright spot in the company's difficult financial period.

Alice knew the real heroes were her team members. In teaching them about thriftiness, she'd also reminded them of their own worth. She looked around the room during their weekly meeting and realized that not only had they saved their jobs and the project, they'd built a stronger, more resilient team.

"In difficult times, it's not about how much you have," Alice mused to herself, "it's about making the most of what you've got." And as she looked at her team—each member busy, but engaged and motivated—she felt a surge of pride. They had learned how to be thrifty, but in the process, they'd also learned something invaluable about their own resilience and ingenuity.

Navigating through financial constraints is something almost every team will face at some point, and Alice's story is an instructive example of how to adapt. Instead of seeing budget cuts as a death knell, consider them a prompt to evaluate the resources you already have. It’s easy to forget the wealth of assets you've accumulated over time, like code libraries, design templates, or even skill sets within your team that haven’t been tapped into lately.

When the threat of layoffs looms large, the natural instinct might be to work harder, put in more hours, or simply cut corners. However, as Alice demonstrated, a more effective and sustainable approach is to leverage what’s already available. Engage your team in identifying reusable assets or alternate routes to achieving the same objectives. There's also a side benefit to this approach: a renewed sense of ownership and engagement among team members. When people feel they're part of the solution, their commitment to the project and the team deepens.

Also, don’t underestimate the power of cross-collaboration. Borrowing team members from other departments, even temporarily, can provide fresh perspectives and may accelerate a project. New faces can rejuvenate a team stuck in a rut, and their unique skill sets might be just what you need to solve a particularly tricky problem.

This experience serves as an excellent lesson for team leads and individual contributors alike. In difficult times, it's not just about saving money; it's about intelligently utilizing resources, increasing efficiency, and most importantly, pulling together as a team to weather the storm.

# Self Reflection

1. What existing resources or assets can be repurposed to help meet your current objectives?

2. How often do you engage your team in budget or resource-related decisions? Would more involvement increase their sense of ownership?

3. Can you think of a situation where being thrifty compromised quality? How could it have been avoided?

4. Are there avenues for cross-departmental collaboration that you haven't explored? What might they be?

5. When faced with financial constraints, what's your default action plan? How could you adjust this plan to focus more on thriftiness without sacrificing quality?
