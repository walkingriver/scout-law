# Obedience

Alice looked at the email from upper management one more time, just to make sure she'd read it right. The directive was clear: all teams were to switch to a new project management software by the end of the week, no exceptions. She sighed. The timing was terrible, and she knew that the team was finally comfortable with their existing system. Making this kind of shift would be disruptive and, frankly, demoralizing.

With a measured breath, she called for a team meeting. As they gathered around, Alice could feel the collective tension in the room. News had already spread.

"Look, I get it. The timing of this new software switch isn't ideal," she began, choosing her words carefully. "But we've been given a mandate, and we need to follow it."

A murmur of discontent rippled through the team.

"Here's what we're going to do," Alice continued. "First, we're going to list out what we like about our current system. Then, we'll explore the new software to see how we can replicate as much of that as possible."

Over the next couple of days, the team dived into the new system. Alice had requested one of the product specialists to conduct a personalized walkthrough for her team. They found ways to customize the software to mimic much of the workflow that they had gotten used to in the old system. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was a compromise that preserved team morale as much as possible while obeying the directive.

As they navigated the change, Alice showed her team that obedience to mandates can coexist with ingenuity. They didn't have to be passive recipients of change; they could be active participants who shaped the change to fit their needs as much as possible.

## Obedience in Action

Obedience in a workplace setting isn't just a matter of doing what you're told; it's a complex interplay of loyalty, understanding, and adaptation. Alice showed that while the directive from upper management was non-negotiable, the way it was implemented within her team could still be influenced. Obedience, then, isn't a synonym for submission but rather an exercise in creative problem-solving within the boundaries set by the organization.

In situations where it might be easier to cut corners or ignore mandates, the key to maintaining obedience is remembering the larger context. Every directive is a piece of a bigger puzzle that aims to meet the overarching goals of the company. While it might be tempting to continue using old methods or disregard new protocols, doing so can lead to inconsistencies that affect not just your team but also others who are working under the same mandates.

Additionally, embracing obedience as an opportunity rather than a constraint can lead to surprising innovations. When we are pushed out of our comfort zones, it often forces us to reevaluate and potentially improve existing workflows and processes. It can even serve as a team-building exercise, as team members come together to navigate the challenges posed by the new directives.

The attitude of the leader is crucial here. As a leader, taking a proactive approach to obedience—identifying potential problems, opening lines of communication, and offering constructive solutions—can drastically affect how the rest of the team views the situation. If the leader is visibly committed to making the best out of the directive, it becomes easier for the team to adopt the same attitude.

Remember, obedience doesn't mean sacrificing the team's needs or giving up on innovation. Rather, it's a quality that can coexist with creativity, flexibility, and a concern for the team's well-being. It's about finding the most effective way to align the team's practices with the broader objectives of the organization, even when it's challenging to do so.

## Self-Reflection Questions

1. How do I react when given a directive from higher-ups that I don't agree with?
2. What steps can I take to ensure that following a mandate doesn't erode my team's morale?
3. Have I considered how obeying a directive can be an opportunity for growth, both personally and as a team?
4. Do I communicate clearly with my team when new directives come in, and do I involve them in the process of adaptation?
5. How can I balance the act of obedience with the need for team autonomy and happiness?
