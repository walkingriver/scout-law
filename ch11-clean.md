# Clean

Alice sat down at her desk, taking a moment to look at the sea of monitors displaying various lines of code, charts, and communications platforms. She had always been particular about keeping her workspace organized; today, she felt a deeper need for cleanliness, not just in the physical space but across the board for her team.

"Alright, folks, it's time for a thorough review," she announced at the team meeting. "I'm talking about cleanliness—in our code, our workstations, and even how we present ourselves."

The team looked a bit puzzled but intrigued. With ongoing projects and looming deadlines, cleanliness wasn't usually a top-of-the-agenda topic.

Alice started by emphasizing the importance of clean code. She pulled up a repository on the shared screen and explained that clean code wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about readability and maintainability. She used examples to illustrate that clean code led to fewer errors and smoother collaboration.

From there, she seamlessly transitioned to the topic of workspace cleanliness. Alice pointed out that a clean workspace, both physical and digital, could act as a productivity catalyst. She highlighted the benefits of reducing cognitive load and creating a workflow that helped access what was needed without unnecessary hurdles.

Alice moved on to the subject of personal hygiene, acknowledging that it might be an uncomfortable discussion. She emphasized that personal hygiene was part of professionalism and a shared responsibility. By practicing basic hygiene, the team could contribute to a healthier and more productive workspace.

Professional appearance was the next topic Alice addressed. She clarified that it wasn't about conformity but about being mindful of how they presented themselves. Neatness and cleanliness, she explained, could boost confidence and convey professionalism.

Clean communication followed as the team's focus. Alice highlighted the importance of clear and respectful communication in fostering trust and collaboration. She encouraged the team to choose their words wisely, whether in spoken conversations, code comments, emails, or messages.

Finally, Alice introduced the idea of environmental responsibility. She stressed that their actions had an impact on the environment and encouraged the team to be mindful of waste and energy consumption. She reminded them that small steps could lead to a more sustainable workspace.

In the weeks that followed Alice's detailed meeting on cleanliness, the team started observing noticeable changes. Alice had, perhaps unknowingly, kickstarted a movement that extended beyond clean code and organized desks. Team members found themselves sharing best practices for personal grooming, attire, and even language. The development team that once appeared casual and laid back now displayed an air of professionalism without sacrificing their relaxed culture.

Code reviews became more robust as people paid closer attention to readability and maintainability. Alice noticed that pull requests were cleaner, and code merges happened with fewer conflicts. A new peer-review system was instituted, encouraging everyone to leave the codebase better than they found it.

The workspace underwent a transformation as well. Team members became more organized, labeling folders and creating a standardized filing system for documents. Digital files were categorized and stored in shared drives, allowing for easier access and collaboration. Surprisingly, team members claimed to experience reduced stress levels and enhanced focus, attributing it to the newly organized workspace.

Hygiene became a topic people could openly discuss, thanks to Alice's candid conversation. Sanitizers and hand washes were kept within easy reach, and a routine cleaning schedule was set for shared spaces. It wasn't just about avoiding a distracting odor anymore; it became about collective well-being.

Attire, although a subtle point, saw a shift too. The jeans and t-shirt vibe remained but what changed was the quality. The clothes were cleaner, better-fitted, and more in tune with each individual's professional persona. This wasn't a forced change but a natural progression that occurred as each team member became more conscious of their role in the collective identity of the organization.

Language cleanliness extended beyond avoiding profanity. Team members became more articulate in expressing their thoughts and providing constructive criticism. Emails and messages were more thoughtfully composed, fostering clearer communication and minimizing misunderstandings.

Alice also initiated an eco-friendly drive, where team members were encouraged to minimize paper use and electricity consumption. A small step, yes, but one in the right direction, fostering not just a clean but a sustainable work environment.

As these various elements of "cleanliness" seamlessly integrated into the team's everyday operations, the benefits became apparent. Productivity was up, team morale was high, and most importantly, the workplace turned into an environment that each team member was proud to be a part of. Cleanliness had become an integral part of their team culture, driving them towards excellence.

# Self-Reflection Questions on Cleanliness

1. Have you ever noticed how your code quality impacts the wider project or the work of your teammates? What about the inverse?
