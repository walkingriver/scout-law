# Clean

Alice sat down at her desk, taking a moment to look at the sea of monitors displaying various lines of code, charts, and communications platforms. She had always been particular about keeping her workspace organized; today, she felt a deeper need for cleanliness, not just in the physical space but across the board for her team.

"Alright, folks, it's time for a thorough review," she announced at the team meeting. "I'm talking about cleanliness—in our code, our workstations, and even how we present ourselves."

The team looked a bit puzzled but intrigued. With ongoing projects and looming deadlines, cleanliness wasn't usually a top-of-the-agenda topic.

## Code Cleanliness

"Okay, diving into code cleanliness," Alice continued, pulling up a repository on the shared screen. "Clean code is more than just syntactic sugar. It's about readability and maintainability. Think of it as writing a novel; every character and every sentence should serve a purpose. Clean code avoids hacks, workarounds, and shortcuts. Any time-saving tactics today can easily become a nightmare for someone else—or even yourself—down the line."

Alice could recall instances where lack of clean code had led to delayed projects and increased overhead. "Proper indentation, sensible variable names, and thoughtful architecture are not optional; they're essential. And if you're touching a piece of legacy code, try to refactor it for better clarity, even if it's just a bit."

## Workspace Cleanliness

"Moving onto workspace cleanliness," Alice gestured toward her own meticulously organized desk. "A clean workspace is not just about avoiding physical clutter. It's also about creating a workflow that helps you access what you need without unnecessary hurdles. Digital cleanliness is equally important. Organize your digital files and emails so that you can retrieve them easily. Trust me, a well-organized workspace, both physical and digital, can act as a productivity catalyst."

She also pointed out that a clutter-free workspace can reduce cognitive load, making it easier to focus on the task at hand. "It's like having a clean slate every day. It's refreshing and invigorating."

## Team Hygiene

"On to hygiene," Alice made eye contact with her team to emphasize the gravity of this often-overlooked issue. "We all know that poor hygiene can be distracting. But beyond that, it's also a matter of public health, especially in a shared environment. Regular handwashing, using hand sanitizer, and basic grooming can go a long way. If you're coming from the gym, for instance, maybe freshen up before entering the workspace. We're all in this together, so let's be considerate."

Alice knew that the topic could be awkward but crucial for a professional setting. "Health is a collective responsibility. Let's make sure we're contributing to a healthy workspace in every way we can."

## Professional Appearance

Alice paused before speaking again. "Your attire is more than just fabric; it's a statement about your professionalism. No, you don't have to wear a three-piece suit, but what you wear should respect the culture of the workplace and the people in it. Each company has its own culture. Whether it's business casual or jeans and t-shirts, the key is to be neat and clean."

She elaborated on the cultural nuance of attire. "It's not just about not standing out for the wrong reasons. It's also about conveying that you understand and respect the collective identity of the organization. Your attire says a lot about how you perceive yourself and your role within the team."

## Clean Language

"As for language," Alice leaned forward, "it's the most direct way we communicate. Profanity or sloppy language not only makes the speaker look bad but can also create an uncomfortable environment for others. Clean language is not about censorship; it's about respect. It's about communicating your thoughts clearly and effectively without offending or distracting."

She also extended the concept to written communications. "The way we write—be it comments in the code, emails, or even text messages—should adhere to the same principle. Clear, clean language helps to avoid misunderstandings and builds a foundation of trust."

## Environmental Cleanliness

Alice decided to introduce another angle. "One topic we haven't touched upon is environmental cleanliness. We should all aim to minimize waste and be environmentally responsible. Use digital formats over paper where possible, recycle, and be conscious of energy use. A clean leader also thinks about the bigger picture, which includes the footprint we leave on the planet."

In the weeks that followed Alice's detailed meeting on cleanliness, the team started observing noticeable changes. Alice had, perhaps unknowingly, kickstarted a movement that extended beyond clean code and organized desks. Team members found themselves sharing best practices for personal grooming, attire, and even language. The development team that once appeared casual and laid back now displayed an air of professionalism without sacrificing their relaxed culture.

Code reviews became more robust as people paid closer attention to readability and maintainability. Alice noticed that pull requests were cleaner, and code merges happened with fewer conflicts. A new peer-review system was instituted, encouraging everyone to leave the codebase better than they found it.

The workspace underwent a transformation as well. Team members became more organized, labeling folders and creating a standardized filing system for documents. Digital files were categorized and stored in shared drives, allowing for easier access and collaboration. Surprisingly, team members claimed to experience reduced stress levels and enhanced focus, attributing it to the newly organized workspace.

Hygiene became a topic people could openly discuss, thanks to Alice's candid conversation. Sanitizers and handwashes were kept within easy reach, and a routine cleaning schedule was set for shared spaces. It wasn't just about avoiding a distracting odor anymore; it became about collective well-being.

Attire, although a subtle point, saw a shift too. The jeans and t-shirt vibe remained but what changed was the quality. The clothes were cleaner, better-fitted, and more in tune with each individual's professional persona. This wasn't a forced change but a natural progression that occurred as each team member became more conscious of their role in the collective identity of the organization.

Language cleanliness extended beyond avoiding profanity. Team members became more articulate in expressing their thoughts and providing constructive criticism. Emails and messages were more thoughtfully composed, fostering clearer communication and minimizing misunderstandings.

Alice also initiated an eco-friendly drive, where team members were encouraged to minimize paper use and electricity consumption. A small step, yes, but one in the right direction, fostering not just a clean but a sustainable work environment.

As these various elements of "cleanliness" seamlessly integrated into the team's everyday operations, the benefits became apparent. Productivity was up, team morale was high, and most importantly, the workplace turned into an environment that each team member was proud to be a part of.

# Self-Reflection Questions on Cleanliness

1. Have you ever noticed how your code quality impacts the wider project or the work of your teammates? What about the inverse?
2. How does the state of your physical and digital workspace affect your daily productivity? Have you considered its impact on your mental well-being?
3. Do you think your personal grooming habits contribute to the overall work environment? In what ways?
4. Have you ever considered that your attire sends a message not just about you, but also about your respect for your colleagues and the organization?
5. How often do you think about the language you use in a professional setting? Have you ever noticed how it affects your interpersonal relationships and team dynamics?

By reflecting on these questions, you'll become more aware of the smaller but significant aspects of cleanliness that collectively contribute to a more effective and harmonious work environment.
