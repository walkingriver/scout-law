# What is the Scout Law?

One of the very first things I learned in Scouting was The Scout Law. It's a set of 12 principles that every scout is expected to follow. Before diving into each one in detail, I thought it would be good to summarize them here, and then see how they might be relevant to leaders.

## The Scout Law Itself

### A Scout is:

1. **TRUSTWORTHY.** Tell the truth and keep promises. People can depend on you.

2. **LOYAL.** Show that you care about your family, friends, Scout leaders, school, and country.

3. **HELPFUL.** Volunteer to help others without expecting a reward.

4. **FRIENDLY.** Be a friend to everyone, even people who are very different from you.

5. **COURTEOUS.** Be polite to everyone and always use good manners.

6. **KIND.** Treat others as you want to be treated. Never harm or kill any living thing without good reason.

7. **OBEDIENT.** Follow the rules of your family, school, and pack. Obey the laws of your community and country.

8. **CHEERFUL.** Look for the bright side of life. Cheerfully do tasks that come your way. Try to help others be happy.

9. **THRIFTY.** Work to pay your own way. Try not to be wasteful. Use time, food, supplies, and natural resources wisely.

10. **BRAVE.** Face difficult situations even when you feel afraid. Do what you think is right despite what others might be doing or saying.

11. **CLEAN.** Keep your body and mind fit. Help keep your home and community clean.

12. **REVERENT.** Be reverent toward God. Be faithful in your religious duties. Respect the beliefs of others.

## How the Scout Law Applies to Leadership

The Scout Law provides a useful framework for leadership in a professional setting. The 12 points of the law cover a range of traits that are essential for ethical and effective leadership. By prioritizing these traits, leaders can build strong relationships with their team members, customers, and stakeholders, and create a positive and productive work environment.

For example, a leader who prioritizes trustworthiness will inspire confidence and build strong relationships with their team members and stakeholders. A leader who is loyal to their organization and team members will foster a culture of commitment and unity within the team. A leader who is helpful and kind will encourage collaboration and support among team members. A leader who is obedient to ethical standards and legal requirements will create a culture of integrity and accountability within the organization. By prioritizing these and other traits from the Scout Law, leaders can cultivate a culture of ethical and effective leadership in their organizations.

With that in mind, look at the list again. A ~~Scout~~ Leader is:

- Trustworthy

- Loyal

- Helpful

- Friendly

- Courteous

- Kind

- Obedient

- Cheerful

- Thrifty

- Brave

- Clean

- Reverent

Wouldn't you like to work for someone who lives those principles? Is there anything in that list you think wouldn't apply to a good leader?

Some might argue that "reverent" doesn't fit with leadership in a corporate environment, but as you will see, I will argue that it does.
